# 🎉 New Features: Personalization & Memory

Your chat interface just got a major upgrade! Here's what's new:

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Personal Name Recognition** 👤
- **First Visit**: Chat asks for the user's name
- **Throughout Conversation**: AI addresses the user by name naturally
- **Persistent**: Name is remembered across sessions

### 2. **Chat History Memory** 💾
- **Auto-Save**: Conversations saved automatically to browser localStorage
- **Persistent**: Chat history survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- **Private**: All data stays in the user's browser (never sent to a server)

### 3. **User Controls** 🎛️
- **Clear Chat**: Button to reset conversation history
- **Change Name**: Button to update how the AI addresses you
- **Smart Welcome**: Returns with "Welcome back, [Name]!" message

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### First Visit Flow:
```
1. User opens chat
2. "Before we start, may I know your name?"
3. User enters name: "Sarah"
4. "Great to meet you, Sarah! 😊"
5. Name + chat saved to localStorage
```

### Returning Visit:
```
1. User opens chat
2. "Welcome back, Sarah! 👋"
3. Previous chat history restored
4. Conversation continues seamlessly
```

### During Conversation:
```
AI naturally uses name:
- "That's a great question, Sarah!"
- "Sarah, I'd recommend..."
- "Let me help you with that, Sarah."
```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Storage Keys:
- `ps_chat_messages`: Stores message history
- `ps_user_name`: Stores user's name

### Storage Type:
**localStorage** (not cookies):
- ✅ More storage space (5-10MB vs 4KB)
- ✅ Never expires (until cleared)
- ✅ Never sent to server (better privacy)
- ✅ Easier to use
- ✅ Perfect for chat history

### Name Context Injection:
```javascript
const contextualMessages = [
  { 
    role: 'assistant', 
    content: `[Context: The customer's name is ${userName}. 
              Address them naturally by name when appropriate.]` 
  },
  ...messages
];
```

This context is sent with each API request so the AI knows the user's name.

**File**: `/src/components/chat-interface.tsx`
- Full React implementation
- Uses React hooks for state management
- TypeScript for type safety

**File**: `/SHOPIFY-NATIVE-EMBED.html`
- Standalone JavaScript version
- Works anywhere (no React needed)
- Copy-paste ready for Shopify

### 3. Deployed Version
**URL**: `https://portable-spas-ai-chat.vercel.app`
- Live with all new features
- Auto-updates when you redeploy

## 🎨 User Experience

### Visual Changes:

**Header (No Name)**:
```
Chat with us
Ask us anything about our portable spas
[Clear chat]
```

**Header (With Name)**:
```
Chat with us
Hi Sarah! Ask us anything about our portable spas
[Clear chat] [Change name]
```

### Conversation Feel:

**Before** (Generic):
```
User: What sizes do you have?
AI:  We have several sizes available...
```

**After** (Personalized):
```
User: What sizes do you have?
AI:  Great question, Sarah! We have several sizes...
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What's Stored:
- ✅ User's name
- ✅ Chat message history
- ❌ No personal data
- ❌ No payment info
- ❌ No tracking data

### Where It's Stored:
- **Browser Only**: localStorage on user's device
- **Never on server**: Your Vercel API doesn't store anything
- **Pinecone**: Only sees messages, not name (unless in context)

### User Control:
- Users can clear chat anytime
- Users can change name anytime
- Users can clear browser data to reset everything

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When Name is Used:
✅ **Good**:
- "That's a great question, Sarah!"
- "Let me help you with that, Sarah."
- "Sarah, I'd recommend..."

❌ **Avoid**:
- "Sarah Sarah Sarah..." (too much)
- Every single response
- Forced/unnatural usage

### AI Behavior:
The AI uses the name **naturally** - not in every message, just when it feels conversational and appropriate.

---

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users:
1. **Feels Personal**: Like talking to a real person
2. **Convenient**: No need to re-explain on return

### For You (Business):
1. **Higher Engagement**: Personal touch increases trust
2. **Better UX**: Seamless conversations
3. **Reduced Friction**: Returning users continue seamlessly
4. **Professional**: Shows attention to detail

content: 'Hey there! 👋 What's your name?'
```

content: `Great to meet you, ${userName}! 😊\n\nHow can I help...`

// Change to:
content: `Nice to meet you, ${userName}! What can I do for you?`
```

### Disable Name Feature:

}];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Name Not Saved?
- Check browser supports localStorage
- Check not in private/incognito mode
- Check browser storage not full

### History Not Loading?
- Check console for localStorage errors
- Try clearing and starting fresh
- Verify JSON is valid in storage

### AI Not Using Name?
- Check context is being sent to API
- Verify userName variable is set
- Check Pinecone API receiving context
