## Filter Cleaning And Replacement

### 🎥 VIDEO GUIDES

Filters should be cleaned at least once per week, but as a rule wash them thoroughly with a garden hose anytime filters start to look brown in colour like in this video: Filters should be replaced WITH NEW EVERY 4-6 WEEKS. Filters older than this may appear clean but the paper pleats will begin to break down, restricting flow and likely causing heating errors or flow errors to appear on your touchpad/smart control. RECYCLING FILTERS WILL EVENTUALLY NOT WORK AND WILL CAUSE ISSUES WITH YOUR SYSTEM Good practice is to skim any hair, lint, leaves etc out of the pool as soon as you see it and to turn off the heater/filter when removing the filter to clean or replace it. This avoids inadvertently sucking any debris through the system. Debris unknowingly sucked inside the control unit can interfere with the inlet and outlet flow switches, as seen below, and will result in flow errors. 120 Pleat Filters can be purchased here

What Causes Limescale? Limescale develops when the pH of the water is left consistently higher than the pH OK Range of the test strips. The high pH causes any calcium in the water to crystallise, which normally happens within the heater due to the reduced surface area inside the heater. If left unchecked, scale will continue to form and will eventually choke the heater completely. Detecting Limescale Scale can often be detected visually by noticing white "flakes" in the water, usually on the floor of the spa underneath the outlet or within the outlet grill. Many people mistake this for chemicals which did not fully dissolve. You may also notice a white chalky buildup on the spa walls. If you believe you may have limescale, an easy thing to check is the inlets and outlets on the control unit. These will generally have a chalky white residue all around if limescale is present. Inspecting the Heater If you want to go one step further, grab the 3 grey threaded caps that came with the spa and screw into the inlet, outlet and bubbler line (the bubbler cap connects on the outside of the spa). This will save you from losing all of your spa water. Now undo the three grey collars connecting the control unit to the spa. Pull the control unit away from the spa far enough to give yourself enough room to easily access the back flat panel. Unscrew the 5 back panel screws and you will have a good view of the heater. Look at where the metal meets the plastic. If the heater is full of limescale, you will usually see the scale forcing its way out of the heater seam. Please note that for customers with a smart control unit, the spa would first need to be drained and then removed from the shell to access the heater. Effects of Limescale on Your Control Unit Limescale can have a number of undesirable effects on your control unit: Flow Restriction and Errors As the scale continues to form, flow becomes restricted through the heater and the flow switches detect a problem. To avoid damaging the system, the control unit will start to present flow errors such as E1 or F1. Reduced Heating Efficiency Because limescale coats the inside of the heater element, output from the heater is reduced. This can lead to increased times to heat the spa water to the set temperature and therefore increased electrical bills. Heater High Limit Activation You may also come out to your spa and discover the water is much colder than the temperature you had set and doesn't appear to be heating at all, even though the heat icon is illuminated. Because of restricted flow and a scale coated element, the internal temperature of the heater can quickly reach 45&deg;C. This causes the heater high limit to activate to avoid causing severe internal damage to the system. The heat icon will remain on but the heater has disengaged itself from the active circuit, meaning no power is going to the heater. The yellow cord rest will need to be pulled to reset the heater's high limit function. This is only a temporary fix as the high limit will again soon activate because the scale buildup is causing the heater to overheat. If your heater has recently been replaced, you will notice that there is no longer a yellow pull cord. This is because replacement heaters now have a built in reset. If the heater becomes too hot internally (45&deg;C) it will disengage itself from the active circuit to avoid damaging the system. The heat icon will remain on, however, and appear to be heating but no power is actually going to the heater. Once the temperature inside the heater cools below 45&deg;C, it will re-engage the active and begin heating again as required. This eliminates the need for a manual reset. Complete Heater Failure Lastly, because the heater is working so hard and trying to heat through a coat of limescale, it will eventually fail completely. This will result in the RCD tripping every time the heater is engaged. Prevention is Key The best way to prevent scale from forming in your control unit and spa is to test and balance your water at least weekly. Pay close attention to the pH and add appropriate chemicals as required to keep the pH in the OK Range. Limescale is a watercare issue and is therefore not covered under warranty, so it becomes a costly experience that could have been avoided with weekly water testing and balancing. Should you have limescale, you would be responsible for all costs associated with getting the control unit to and from our technical team in Christchurch, technician time of one hour and cost of a replacement heater. Caution: Avoid Overcorrecting pH If you have had limescale in the past or are afraid of getting limescale, be sure not to intentionally keep the pH below the OK Range on your test strips. A low pH causes the spa water to become acidic and therefore corrosive. In addition to causing problems with the heater, a pH too low or too high outside of the OK Range will also damage other components such as the filter pump, cause seals to leak and will damage the spa shell itself. Treating Existing Limescale If you start to see limescale, aside from testing and balancing your water, it's a good idea to purchase a descaling chemical from a local pool and spa shop. Be sure it is rated for spas and not just for pools. White Vinegar Treatment Method Several of our customers have had success with running white vinegar through their systems to remove the buildup. Depending on the severity of the scale, this may or may not work for you. To do this: Disconnect or remove the control unit from the spa (depending on your model) Lay the unit on its back so the inlet, outlet and bubbler outlet are facing up Pour 1 litre of white vinegar into the heater outlet. This is the lower opening on the left (NOT THE BOTTOM CENTRAL OPENING WHICH IS THE BUBBLER) Allow to sit for 2-4 hours Stand unit upright and place garden hose in front of inlet (top right opening) and turn on. DO NOT USE A HIGH PRESSURE NOZZLE AS THIS CAN DAMAGE THE FLOW SWITCH If the vinegar has broken down the scale, you should see white "gunk" being forced out of the lower outlet. Continue flushing until water from outlet becomes clear Once water is clear, continue flushing for an additional 2 minutes. This ensures all of the vinegar is flushed from the system. If not flushed long enough, residual vinegar will enter your spa water and wreak havoc on your pH Reconnect or re-install control unit and run as per normal operation Additional Resources For more information regarding water balancing and amount of chemicals to add, please see the Updated Portable Spas Water Care Guide.

## Older Spa Models and 120 Pleat Filters

120 Pleat filters do not require the cartridge filter bayonet as shown above. The base of the bayonet is essentially built into the 120 pleat filters and the filter itself locks on to the grey inlet disc inside the spa, eliminating the need for the bayonet. You can purchase 120 pleat filters here The 90 pleat filters have now been discontinued and are no longer available. Our entire spa range now runs on the 120 pleat filters PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BLUE SOCK COVERING THAT CAME STANDARD WITH THE 90 PLEAT FILTERS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE 120 PLEAT FILTERS. IF A BLUE SOCK COVERING IS USED ON A 120 PLEAT FILTER, IT WILL RESULT IN AN E1 OR F1 FLOW ERROR.

## Insect and Rodent Mayhem

Insects such as ants and cockroaches can cause severe damage to your control unit. Slugs and rodents also seem particularly fond of the heat coming from your control box, especially during the winter months. If you notice any of these near your spa pool, set out baits or traps accordingly as unfortunately these creatures most often end up inside the main power board housing once inside the unit. As you can imagine, hundreds of ants, a few cockroaches or one decent sized slug or small mouse touching a live terminal ends poorly for the offending pest(s)-- and generally shorts out your main power board. Mice can also chew through main water lines between the pump and heater or through the internal bubbler line, causing leaks or making bubblers ineffective. In addition to taking your spa offline, any repairs required due to pests is not covered under warranty and can be expensive repairs to get you up and running again.

## How To Operate The Heating Timer

The timer function on your smart control or top panel works differently to a conventional timer. You CANNOT set specific times of day that you would like the spa to filter/heat. The timer allows you to set HOURS FROM NOW that you would like the heater to activate. For instance: It is currently 9am. You do not get home until 6 pm from work and would like to use the spa from 8pm onwards. You have your insulation bladder in place, the cover is on and the water temperature is set for 40 degrees. Your smart control/top panel shows the current water temperature is 39C. It's warm outside so you wouldn't expect the spa water temperature to drop more than 5 degrees between now and 8pm. Depending on the model of spa you have, the heater should raise the temperature of the water at least 1 degree per hour. With this in mind, you'd like the spa to resume heating at 3 pm to make sure it is up to temperature by 8pm. Press the TIMER button to enter timer mode. 1H will show on the display. Press the UP or Down button to change the hour amount. In this case, you would set 6H. After setting the desired hour, hour set will flash three times before displaying the current water temperature. The timer icon will flash on smart controls or illuminate on Frame series top panels to show that the timer has been set. In the above scenario we set 6H because it is 9am and we want the heater to engage at 3pm. This is 6 hours FROM NOW. Any time set on the timer is HOURS FROM NOW that you want the heater to engage. To de-activate the timer, press and hold the TIMER button for 3 seconds. The smart control/top panel will beep once and the timer icon will no longer flash or appear. Pressing the HEATER button will also de-activate the timer. Please note the following: Any time set on the timer is erased once the heater engages, ie 3pm in the above scenario. The timer does not store set times in memory so if you wanted the heater to come on every day at 3pm, you would need to manually set HOURS FROM NOW in which it would be 3pm. THE TIMER CANNOT BE SET WHILST THE HEATER IS ENGAGED. If you wish to use the timer function whilst the heater is engaged, you must first press the HEATER button to disengage the heater and then set the timer as outlined above.

## How Much Should My Spa Running Costs Be?

There are a number of variables that will affect your spa's running cost. These include set temperature, how often you are running the bubbler, if are you keeping the spa covered and using the inflatable bladder when not in use, if you have a heat preservation mat underneath the spa and depending on the model, if you have a 1.5 kW or 2.2 kW heater. On average, our customers report that our 6 man spa range costs roughly $5.00 per day to run in summer and closer to $7.00 per day in winter. These costs do not include the the 8 man Mono which has a greater water volume or the Oslo model which has an additional jet pump. Your first month of spa operation will have the highest energy cost and is not indicative of months to follow. This is because the spa initially has to heat the ambient water temperature to the set temperature. For instance, if you buy your spa in winter and fill it, let's say the water temperature is 10C. You set your desired temperature at 40C, therefore the spa has to heat the water 30 degrees. Depending on your spa model and if you have a 1.5 kW or 2.2 kW heater, the spa heater will raise the temperature of the water 1 to 2 degrees per hour. This means if you have a 1.5 kW heater, the heater will need to continuously run approximately 30 hours to achieve set temperature. Once set temperature is achieved, the heater will only need to raise the temperature 2 to 3 degrees on average to maintain the desired temp after use (although it could be slightly more with consistent use of the bubbler function, especially in colder months). The bubbler draws in ambient outside air into the spa, so use of this function will ultimately lower the temperature of the spa water. You can use the timer option to keep the heater from engaging at times you set. Keep in mind that the water temperature of the spa will slowly drop with the heater not activated and depending on the amount of the drop, it may take more energy to heat the water back up to set temperature vs the heater maintaining a set temperature. Our customers have generally found that leaving the spa running to a set temperature is the most economical and energy efficient. Also please note that the spa filter pump will run continuously with a set temperature. This is nothing to be concerned about and is not unlike many acrylic spas which have 24 hour circulation pumps. Our spa range filter pumps are only 12 volts and 25 watts so energy draw/cost is minimal. For example, if we multiply 25 watts x 24 hours, we get 600 watts. This is .6 kW. The average electrical cost per kW in New Zealand is currently 35.67 cents, so for demonstration purposes we'll say 36 cents. Therefore, if we multiply .36 (36 cents) x .6 kW (600 watts), we get .216. This is approximately 22 cents per day, $6.60 per month (.22 cents x 30 days) or $79.20 per year ($6.60 x 12 months). Heaters are either 1.5 or 2.2 kW. To find the cost of running the heater, you would need to multiply either 1.5 or 2.2 by the number or hours the heater is actually running per day. Then add that number to the cost of the pump running (approximately 22 cents) to get a daily total.

## Power Outages and PRCD Management

Is This You? Living in a location in New Zealand where you sometimes lose power? And especially for those that have an MSpa located at a holiday home or other location away from where they usually reside, the following may be particularly useful and of interest. Frustrated that your MSpa loses power, someone must notice and that person or someone else must go to the spa and reset the PRCD? Understanding New Zealand RCD Requirements In New Zealand, Residual Current Devices (RCDs) are mandated by the Electricity (Safety) Regulations 2010 and associated standards to prevent electric shock and protect property. This is specifically covered in AS/NZS 3000 standard for electrical installations. RCDs must protect all new lighting and power outlet circuits in domestic buildings. Unfortunately regulations require that the import of our MSpas is with a PRCD. The Solution However, as long as your MSpa is being connected to a power outlet that is protected by an RCD, the PRCD is redundant and can be removed by a certified electrician. No more going to use your MSpa and finding that it is not at your ideal temperature due to a power cut.

## Extension leads and MSpas

Flexible Placement Your MSpa can be situated on any flat surface anywhere inside or outside on your property. That flexibility is one of the spa pool's highlights. Easy Relocation If you decide to move it, it is invariably a simple exercise of draining it, optionally deflating it and then moving it to the new location. We have Kiwis that do this each year, switching between the north side and south side of their houses for the summer or winter sun or moving their MSpa to avoid prevailing winds. Electrical Connection Options There have been concerns expressed about the use of extension leads. These concerns can now be a thing of the past. As long as your residential electrical wiring meets the AS/NZS3000 standard in force since 2010, utilising an RCD for all power outlets, a certified electrician can remove the PRCD from your MSpa electrical wiring and provide you with an electric cable at the length you require to connect your MSpa to the power outlet that you want to connect it to.

## Holiday / remote settings

When you aren't going to be using your MSpa for a while, you need not drain it,deflate it and store it away. Of course that is still an option, but some Kiwis choose to put their MSpas into standby mode until they are ready to use their pool again. Standby mode is when you leave power to your MSpa and turn all functions off. No heater, no filter or anything else running. When your MSpa is in standby mode, the control unit will turn the filter on and run it for one hour every eight hours. At a typical 1800L per hour, this means that in standby mode, 3 times per day, the pump will run to circulate your entire MSpa pool water past the filter twice every hour the pump runs. And in standby mode the heater is off, so chemical consumption is also reduced,saving costs there too. Dave's comment: for me and my two MSpas, I'm not necessarily at both locations every week. I used to leave the heater off when I left one of my MSpas, and just ran the filter and UVC the entire time I was away. Now I save even more money by running my MSpas in standby mode. When I know I'm heading to where one of my MSPas is located, I simply use the MSpa Link app on my phone to turn the MSpa heater on at an appropriate time before my arrival so that as soon as I've unpacked, I can relax and soak in my MSpa.

## How Long Can You Leave Your MSpa in Standby Mode?

Dave's comment: I've not yet found the limit. The longest I've left one of my MSpas has been 6 weeks. Quick Method When I'm sure I won't be back at my MSpa within a week or two, if I'm in a hurry I simply check the water balance to ensure it's ideal and put a new or near new filter cartridge on the inlet grill. Thorough Method for Extended Periods If I have time before leaving my MSpa for an indefinite period, I do the following: Clean the valves: With the MSpa filter turned off and the cartridge removed, remove the inlet and outlet valves. Open the valves by undoing the central screw and ensure the valves are clean.PLEASE NOTE: BE SURE NOT TO LOOSEN THE GRILLS WITH THE SUPPLIED GRILL WRENCH FOR UNITS WITH A SMART CONTROL (CONTROL UNIT INSIDE THE SPA WALL). THIS CAN ALLOW WATER TO ENTER THE CONTROL UNIT AND CAUSE DAMAGE. Clean the pipes: Wipe the pipes between the MSpa pool and control unit to ensure there is no residue or debris between the pool and the control unit. Flush the control unit (Frame Series only): For Frame Series MSpa owners (Mono, Oslo, Tuscany and Tribeca), if you have time, also consider using the caps to save the water in your MSpa. Remove the control unit from the MSpa pool and give it a good flush with a hose running the water through the inlet pipe. Install fresh filter: After attaching the control unit, reassembling the inlet and outlet valves, put a new or near new clean filter cartridge on the inlet valve. Balance the water: Ensure your MSpa water is balanced, with the pH within the ideal range 7.2-7.8. Add chemicals as normal to obtain the right balances of pH, alkalinity etc. Add slow-release chlorine: Use a slow-release chemical dispenser. Close the dispenser up completely and add an appropriate amount of spa chlorine (or bromine) tablets to the dispenser and place that in your MSpa. I'll use up to three if I'm not confident I'll be returning within 3 weeks but for a shorter period it might be only one or two tablets. Ongoing Maintenance If your MSpa is at a location where you or someone else can still easily access the spa, consider testing the water again after two or three weeks and adding chemicals if required. Dave's comment: In my 6 week scenario above, all that we needed to do when we returned to our MSpa was to add a normal dose of chlorine. Dave's comment: I've not yet found the limit.

## MSpa Storage Guide

Before Storing Your MSpa Follow these steps to properly prepare your MSpa for storage: 1. Clean the Control Unit Pipes Check your control unit pipes for any residue or debris and give them a good wipe with a cloth or towel. 2. Flush the Control Unit Flush the control unit by turning the hose on and running water through the unit from the inlet pipe until it flows clean and clear out the outlet pipe. 3. Dry the Control Unit Ensure your control unit is dry by holding it in different positions and rolling it from side to side until no more water comes out of the unit. 4. Clean and Dry the Valves Remove the inlet and outlet valves. Open them by undoing the screw in the centre of the grill. Ensure the valves are clean and dry as well as the pipes between your MSpa and the control unit. Reinsert the valves back into your liner or your control unit (depending on which model MSpa you have). 5. Clean and Dry the Liner Give your liner a good wipe down, ensuring it is clean and dry, inside and out. Important Pest Warning Please note that some Kiwis have gone to retrieve their MSpa and found the liner and internals of the control unit have been eaten by mice or rats or that the electrics within their control units have been damaged by snails and slugs. Please take care to ensure you don't have these experiences. Before Setting Up Again Finally, a week or two before you intend setting up and using your MSpa again, please consider booking your control unit for an annual service so you can have confidence you can use it whenever you like without it requiring any unscheduled maintenance.

## Inflatable Insulation Bladder Care

The instructions say stop inflating before all wrinkles have gone. After years of experiencing the deflating insulation bladder, I learnt a few things that I have been applying and haven't had any issues with my insulation bladders since. Proper Inflation Only inflate the bladder enough so it doesn't fall out of the cover (for Mono, Naval and Duet owners) when you put it on your MSpa. The hot water of your MSpa will make the air in the bladder expand. Checking for Over-Inflation When you take your insulation bladder off of your MSpa, if you can't easily push your hand into the inflated bladder then it is over-inflated. Let some air out. Storage Best Practices I used to take my insulation bladder off my MSpa and stand it on its side next to the house or a fence. While the cover provides some protection for the bladder, this practice does expose some of the bladder to sharp objects that could cause a puncture. If Standing on Its Side If your available space requires you to stand the insulation bladder on its side, place it on top of some old beach towels or similar so that the chance of something causing a puncture is minimal. Recommended Storage Method My strong recommendation: if you are able, place the insulation bladder upside down on the cover on a flat surface. This way the cover is protecting the bladder from any sharp objects.

## Filter Cartridge Care

Understanding the Filter Indicator The filter symbol on your MSpa will flash at you when the MSpa determines it's time to replace the filter with a new one. You can reset this indicator by pressing and holding the filter button. In my experience, by the time the MSpa filter indicator is flashing at you, the filter cartridge probably should have been replaced earlier. Factors Affecting Filter Life Filter cartridge cleaning and replacement are very much dependent on: How often you use your MSpa How many people use it Whether bathers have a quick shower before using your MSpa or not If you don't shower before use, even if you are not dirty, sweat, natural oils from your skin, lotions, moisturisers, sun screen and more can all cause you to have to clean or replace your filter cartridge more often. These things can have a direct bearing on the frequency and amount of required chemicals to keep your water in balance. Recommended Cleaning Schedule The following are guidelines for one or two people using the MSpa daily with quick showers just before use: If you use your MSpa less frequently, consider longer durations If you use it more frequently, or more people use your MSpa, or you don't always have a quick shower before use, consider cleaning and replacement more often For Everyday Users Clean your filter cartridge every 3 or 4 days Replace the filter cartridge within 6 weeks Signs Your Filter Needs Replacing If you take the lid off your MSpa and see white residue in the water, it may be caused by other things but it could be an indicator that your filter cartridge is starting to degrade. If that is the case, replace your filter cartridge with a brand new one. Dealing with Debris Note that if you see debris within your MSpa, it's best you scoop that out with a cleaning kit net, rather than leaving it and hoping that the filter cartridge and inlet grill/valve will stop the debris from entering your control unit.

# Troubleshooting

## Blanking Error

The Blanking Error", occurs when the filter pump is faulty. This will cause your display screen to momentarily "blank out" if the filter, heater, ozone or UVC buttons are pushed (any function that requires the filter pump to engage). If you are experiencing the blanking error, please send your control unit only to the address on the form below along with your details and Shopify number if known and include in the box. Write blanking error as the fault. Banana boxes work great for shipping control units. PLEASE SEE NEW COST SAVING SHIPPING POLICY HERE Return Control Unit Form.pdf124.8KB If your spa model has a smart control, please see this video for instructions on how to remove the control unit from the spa shell. WHEN REMOVING THE CONTROL UNIT FROM THE SPA SHELL, BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL REMOVING THE WHITE ROTATION KNOB FROM THE UNIT. AFTER REMOVING THE SCREW HOLDING THE KNOB IN PLACE, GENTLY PULL OUTWARD WHILST GENTLY TURNING THE KNOB. IT WILL SLOWLY COME OUT. WHEN RE-INSERTING THE KNOB WHEN RE-INSTALLING CONTROL UNIT INTO SPA SHELL, VERY GENTLY PUSH INWARDS WHILST ROTATING THE KNOB. YOU WILL FEEL IT LOCK INTO PLACE. THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW. THERE IS A VERY THIN MICROSWITCH UNDERNEATH THE HOLE THE KNOB FITS INTO. IF YOU FORCE THE KNOB IN OR OUT WHEN REMOVING OR RE-INSTALLING, YOU CAN DAMAGE THE MICROSWITCH. THIS WILL RESULT IN BUBBLER NOT WORKING AND THE MICROSWITCH WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. Please note that it is not necessary to contact Portable Spas before sending your unit provided the form is included in the box. Please Do Not Include Inlet And Outlet Grills Nor Rotation Knobs With Your Control Unit.

THE YELLOW CORD RESET WILL NOT RESOLVE AN ERROR CODE. IT WILL ONLY CORRECT A UNIT THAT IS NOT HEATING Hello. We are terribly sorry you are experiencing a flow error with your control unit. The heating unit will default to an E1 or F1 error if it detects a blockage or decreased flow within the system as a way of protecting itself to avoid severe internal damage. Often this is because the filters are dirty and/or need replacing. Filters need to be cleaned at least weekly and replaced with new every 4-6 weeks. Recycling filters will not work as the paper pleats break down over time, restricting flow. When you are cleaning the filter we would also recommend cleaning the filter grills thoroughly as sometimes these can collect debris that the filter doesn't always catch. Please try the following for an E1 or F1 error: Firstly, power up the unit and press the filter button only. If you can't hear the pump running before the error appears or if it sounds louder than normal or unusual, there is an issue with the filter pump. You will need to send the control unit to our tech team to sort the problem. Please send your control unit only to the address on the attached form below along with your details and include in the box. Banana boxes work great for shipping control units. If your spa model has a smart control, please see this video for instructions on how to remove the control unit from the spa shell. WHEN REMOVING THE CONTROL UNIT FROM THE SPA SHELL, BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL REMOVING THE WHITE ROTATION KNOB FROM THE UNIT. AFTER REMOVING THE SCREW HOLDING THE KNOB IN PLACE, GENTLY PULL OUTWARD WHILST GENTLY TURNING THE KNOB. IT WILL SLOWLY COME OUT. WHEN RE-INSERTINGTHE KNOB DURING RE-INSTALLATION OF THE CONTROL UNIT INTO THE SPA SHELL, VERY GENTLY PUSH INWARDS WHILST ROTATING THE KNOB. YOU WILL FEEL IT LOCK INTO PLACE. THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW. THERE IS A VERY THIN MICROSWITCH UNDERNEATH THE HOLE THE KNOB FITS INTO. IF YOU FORCE THE KNOB IN OR OUT WHEN REMOVING OR RE-INSTALLING, YOU CAN DAMAGE THE MICROSWITCH. THIS WILL RESULT IN BUBBLER NOT WORKING AND THE MICROSWITCH WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. Please note that it is not necessary to contact Portable Spas before sending your unit provided the form is included in the box. Please Do Not Include Inlet And Outlet Grills Nor Rotation Knobs With Your Control Unit. Return Control Unit Form.pdf124.8KB PLEASE SEE NEW COST SAVING SHIPPING POLICY HERE If you can hear the pump running and sounds normal, we have identified that the pump is not the issue. Please proceed with the following steps: Turn the heating unit completely off. To do this, either go to your PRCD on the unit and press the test function or switch off power to your unit at the wall. Now reach inside your spa and turn the filter to the left to remove it from the inlet grill. We recommend that you clean the filter at least once per week and replace the filter completely every 4-6 weeks. 120 Pleat Filters can be purchased here Put the filter to the side. If your spa model has a filter cartridge base, unscrew the filter cartridge base to the left, releasing it from the inlet filter grill and also put it to the side. Use your hand to rub away any debris from the grill. Get your garden hose and turn it on. Move it all around both the inlet and outlet grills to give them a good clean. ● On occasion the filter inlet and outlet grills will need to be removed to be cleaned out properly. If this is required you will need to drain the water level of the spa so it rests BELOW THE GRILLS. IF YOU REMOVE EITHER GRILL WHILST UNDER WATER IT WILL CAUSE CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO YOUR HEATING UNIT! Once water level is safely below the grills you can use the wrench tool that came with your spa and unscrew them. Remove and give a thorough wash. With filter grills removed, it is also a good idea to look inside the inlet and outlet at the hanging "flappers"- these are the flow switches. See if any lint, hair, etc has made its way through the system and is interfering with the flow switches working properly as seen below. If so, gently reach inside the inlet and outlet with a small flathead screwdriver or tweezers, etc and remove the debris. Good practice is to skim any hair, lint, leaves etc out of the pool as soon as you see it and to turn off the heater/filter when removing the filter to clean or replace to avoid inadvertently sucking any debris through the system. After cleaning is complete, screw the grills back onto the side of the spa making sure they are tight. Be sure that the grill with the prongs on each side screws into the top hole. Here is a YouTube video on how to remove and clean the inlet and outlet filter grills: Screw the filter back onto the inlet grill or refit the filter cartridge base if your spa has one and then refit the filter. Refill spa (up to the max line if needed). Turn the switch at the wall back on to power the unit and/or go to the PRCD on the power cord and press reset to turn your spa back on. Then press test to make sure it turns off. Press reset again. Operate spa as normal. If the E1//F1 error appears immediately after powering back up, press and hold the temp down button three seconds to clear. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BLUE FILTER SOCK COVERINGS ON OLDER MODELS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE 120 PLEAT (NON-CARTRIDGE BASE) FILTERS AND WILL CAUSE AN E1/F1 ERROR. A water level below the inlet grill or people splashing in the pool can cause the system to intake air and may also result in an E1 or F1 error. If you have a Mono, Tuscany or Tribeca model that is showing an F1 code and have filled it for the very first time or have drained the spa and just refilled it, you likely have an airlock. Turn the control unit off and go to the top pipe connection between the spa and the control unit as shown below. Loosen the grey threaded collar and you should hear air escape. Once you no longer hear the escaping air and water starts to trickle out, tighten the connection back up. Turn power to the control unit back on and press heater. You should now hear water moving through the system and the error will no longer appear. If none of the above has corrected the problem, you will need to send your control unit only to our technical team in Christchurch to assess. Please send the control unit to the address on the Return Control Unit Form attachment below and include the form with your details and Shopify number if known inside the box.

Filters should be cleaned at least once per week, but as a rule wash them thoroughly with a garden hose anytime filters start to look brown in colour like in this video: Filters should be replaced WITH NEW EVERY 4-6 WEEKS. Filters older than this may appear clean but the paper pleats will begin to break down, restricting flow and likely causing heating errors or flow errors to appear on your touchpad/smart control. RECYCLING FILTERS WILL EVENTUALLY NOT WORK AND WILL CAUSE ISSUES WITH YOUR SYSTEM Good practice is to skim any hair, lint, leaves etc out of the pool as soon as you see it and to turn off the heater/filter when removing the filter to clean or replace it. This avoids inadvertently sucking any debris through the system. Debris unknowingly sucked inside the control unit can interfere with the inlet and outlet flow switches, as seen below, and will result in flow errors. 120 Pleat Filters can be purchased here

What Causes Limescale? Limescale develops when the pH of the water is left consistently higher than the pH OK Range of the test strips. The high pH causes any calcium in the water to crystallise, which normally happens within the heater due to the reduced surface area inside the heater. If left unchecked, scale will continue to form and will eventually choke the heater completely. Detecting Limescale Scale can often be detected visually by noticing white "flakes" in the water, usually on the floor of the spa underneath the outlet or within the outlet grill. Many people mistake this for chemicals which did not fully dissolve. You may also notice a white chalky buildup on the spa walls. If you believe you may have limescale, an easy thing to check is the inlets and outlets on the control unit. These will generally have a chalky white residue all around if limescale is present. Inspecting the Heater If you want to go one step further, grab the 3 grey threaded caps that came with the spa and screw into the inlet, outlet and bubbler line (the bubbler cap connects on the outside of the spa). This will save you from losing all of your spa water. Now undo the three grey collars connecting the control unit to the spa. Pull the control unit away from the spa far enough to give yourself enough room to easily access the back flat panel. Unscrew the 5 back panel screws and you will have a good view of the heater. Look at where the metal meets the plastic. If the heater is full of limescale, you will usually see the scale forcing its way out of the heater seam. Please note that for customers with a smart control unit, the spa would first need to be drained and then removed from the shell to access the heater. Effects of Limescale on Your Control Unit Limescale can have a number of undesirable effects on your control unit: Flow Restriction and Errors As the scale continues to form, flow becomes restricted through the heater and the flow switches detect a problem. To avoid damaging the system, the control unit will start to present flow errors such as E1 or F1. Reduced Heating Efficiency Because limescale coats the inside of the heater element, output from the heater is reduced. This can lead to increased times to heat the spa water to the set temperature and therefore increased electrical bills. Heater High Limit Activation You may also come out to your spa and discover the water is much colder than the temperature you had set and doesn't appear to be heating at all, even though the heat icon is illuminated. Because of restricted flow and a scale coated element, the internal temperature of the heater can quickly reach 45&deg;C. This causes the heater high limit to activate to avoid causing severe internal damage to the system. The heat icon will remain on but the heater has disengaged itself from the active circuit, meaning no power is going to the heater. The yellow cord rest will need to be pulled to reset the heater's high limit function. This is only a temporary fix as the high limit will again soon activate because the scale buildup is causing the heater to overheat. If your heater has recently been replaced, you will notice that there is no longer a yellow pull cord. This is because replacement heaters now have a built in reset. If the heater becomes too hot internally (45&deg;C) it will disengage itself from the active circuit to avoid damaging the system. The heat icon will remain on, however, and appear to be heating but no power is actually going to the heater. Once the temperature inside the heater cools below 45&deg;C, it will re-engage the active and begin heating again as required. This eliminates the need for a manual reset. Complete Heater Failure Lastly, because the heater is working so hard and trying to heat through a coat of limescale, it will eventually fail completely. This will result in the RCD tripping every time the heater is engaged. Prevention is Key The best way to prevent scale from forming in your control unit and spa is to test and balance your water at least weekly. Pay close attention to the pH and add appropriate chemicals as required to keep the pH in the OK Range. Limescale is a watercare issue and is therefore not covered under warranty, so it becomes a costly experience that could have been avoided with weekly water testing and balancing. Should you have limescale, you would be responsible for all costs associated with getting the control unit to and from our technical team in Christchurch, technician time of one hour and cost of a replacement heater. Caution: Avoid Overcorrecting pH If you have had limescale in the past or are afraid of getting limescale, be sure not to intentionally keep the pH below the OK Range on your test strips. A low pH causes the spa water to become acidic and therefore corrosive. In addition to causing problems with the heater, a pH too low or too high outside of the OK Range will also damage other components such as the filter pump, cause seals to leak and will damage the spa shell itself. Treating Existing Limescale If you start to see limescale, aside from testing and balancing your water, it's a good idea to purchase a descaling chemical from a local pool and spa shop. Be sure it is rated for spas and not just for pools. White Vinegar Treatment Method Several of our customers have had success with running white vinegar through their systems to remove the buildup. Depending on the severity of the scale, this may or may not work for you. To do this: Disconnect or remove the control unit from the spa (depending on your model) Lay the unit on its back so the inlet, outlet and bubbler outlet are facing up Pour 1 litre of white vinegar into the heater outlet. This is the lower opening on the left (NOT THE BOTTOM CENTRAL OPENING WHICH IS THE BUBBLER) Allow to sit for 2-4 hours Stand unit upright and place garden hose in front of inlet (top right opening) and turn on. DO NOT USE A HIGH PRESSURE NOZZLE AS THIS CAN DAMAGE THE FLOW SWITCH If the vinegar has broken down the scale, you should see white "gunk" being forced out of the lower outlet. Continue flushing until water from outlet becomes clear Once water is clear, continue flushing for an additional 2 minutes. This ensures all of the vinegar is flushed from the system. If not flushed long enough, residual vinegar will enter your spa water and wreak havoc on your pH Reconnect or re-install control unit and run as per normal operation Additional Resources For more information regarding water balancing and amount of chemicals to add, please see the Updated Portable Spas Water Care Guide.

## Unit is Running But Not Heating

### 🎥 VIDEO GUIDES

THE YELLOW CORD RESET WILL NOT RESOLVE AN ERROR CODE. IT WILL ONLY CORRECT A UNIT THAT IS NOT HEATING Hello. We are terribly sorry you are experiencing a heating issue with your control unit. Please try the following if your unit is running but is not heating or is losing heat: ● Turn power off to the unit either by going to your PRCD on the control box cord and pressing the test function or by switching off power to your unit at the wall. ● Go to the heating unit and slide your hand underneath. Locate the yellow reset cord and pull it gently until it stops. You should hear a faint clicking sound which confirms the heater was reset. Here is a YouTube video showing the yellow cord heater reset. ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** Pulling the cord too hard will force the reset arm off its hinge and will not reset the heater ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ● Turn the switch at the wall back on to power the unit and/or go to the PRCD on the control box cord and press reset to turn your spa back on. Then press test to make sure it turns off. Press reset again. Operate spa as normal. You should notice the spa climbing in temperature approximately 1C - 1.5C per hour. Please note that if the heater needs to be reset, the internal temperature of the heater has reached 45C. If this happens, the heater reset pops, which means the heater disengages itself from the active circuit so as not to damage the system. Panel/Smart Control functions will appear normal but no power is being supplied to the heater. The biggest cause of the heater reset popping is dirty filters or filters over 6 weeks old as they restrict flow through the heater which in turn causes the internal temperature of the heater to get too hot. A water level below the inlet grill or people splashing in the pool can cause the system to intake air and can also result in the internal temperature of the heater exceeding 45C, therefore activating the heater high limit which will need to be reset. If your new spa out of the box is not heating, the yellow cord reset will likely correct the problem. The heater high limit can sometimes inadvertently activate during shipping due to the movement and vibration of being transported. If you think you have accidentally pulled the reset cord too hard, preventing the heater from resetting, you can easily check the reset arm for all Frame series spas as shown here. Please note that although a non-Frame control unit is used for the demo, the process is the same. For all spa models that have an internal control unit, you would first need to remove the control unit from the spa shell as shown below in order to check the reset arm. WHEN REMOVING THE CONTROL UNIT FROM THE SPA SHELL, BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL REMOVING THE WHITE ROTATION KNOB FROM THE UNIT. AFTER REMOVING THE SCREW HOLDING THE KNOB IN PLACE, GENTLY PULL OUTWARD WHILST GENTLY TURNING THE KNOB. IT WILL SLOWLY COME OUT. WHEN RE-INSERTING THE KNOB WHEN RE-INSTALLING CONTROL UNIT INTO SPA SHELL, VERY GENTLY PUSH INWARDS WHILST ROTATING THE KNOB. YOU WILL FEEL IT LOCK INTO PLACE. THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW. THERE IS A VERY THIN MICROSWITCH UNDERNEATH THE HOLE THE KNOB FITS INTO. IF YOU FORCE THE KNOB IN OR OUT WHEN REMOVING OR RE-INSTALLING, YOU CAN DAMAGE THE MICROSWITCH. THIS WILL RESULT IN BUBBLER NOT WORKING AND THE MICROSWITCH WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. If the unit continues to pop the heater reset and filters are clean and/or new, it is very possible you have limescale in the heater. Limescale is a crystalised buildup of calcium that develops when the pH is too high in the spa, so be sure to test your water weekly and adjust pH as required to stay within the ok range to avoid this happening again in the future. If none of the above has corrected the problem or the reset continues to pop, possibly due to limescale, you will need to send your control unit only to our technical team in Christchurch to assess. Please send the control unit to the address on the Return Control Unit Form attachment below and include the form with your details and Shopify number if known inside the box. Banana boxes work great for shipping control units. Please note that it is not necessary to contact Portable Spas before sending your unit provided the form is included in the box.

## Spa is Deflating

If your new spa won't stay inflated, please check the following: For Mono, Naval and Duet spas, check that the yellow spring valve is in the out position as shown below. If the yellow spring valve is not out, press the valve and turn. This will release the valve to the out position. If the spa continues to leak, use the supplied SUP wrench to tighten the inflation valve as shown below. If the spa is still deflating, please contact customer service here. For all other inflatable models, locate the Manometer and turn it as tight as possible by hand. On occasion these ship loose from the factory. For all models except the Aurora, if the spa continues to deflate, be sure to turn the white inflation knob to the off position after inflating. Failing to do so leaves the inflation valve open and air will gradually escape from the spa shell If all of the above have been performed and the spa continues to deflate, please contact customer service here.

## Spa has a leak or puncture

If you have an older spa that has developed a leak from an unknown source outside of the warranty period, please follow instructions as shown in the following video. All spa models ship with leak repair patches but not glue. We have found inflatable boat repair kit glue works the best and can be found at marine supply shops such as Burnsco https://www.burnsco.co.nz/inflatable-boat-repair-kit-pvc-250ml. If you have an older spa that is outside of warranty which has developed a leak or puncture from a known source, please refer to the following video from approximately 50 seconds on. All spa models ship with leak repair patches but not glue. We have found inflatable boat repair kit glue works the best and can be found at marine supply shops such as Burnsco. See here https://www.burnsco.co.nz/inflatable-boat-repair-kit-pvc-250ml. Any of our spa models found to have a seam leak within the 12 month warranty period will be replaced with a new liner. If this is you, please contact customer service here. With the exception of a newly opened spa, punctures from an outside source are not covered under warranty.

## M-Spa App Says Flow Is Weak

If you receive a message on your M-Spa wifi app saying that you have weak flow, THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH YOUR HEATING/FILTERING SYSTEM. It is a reminder to clean or replace your filters akin to the top panel filter icon flashing. The app is not actually measuring flow; however if there is a flow issue you will receive an F1 error code. If your filter is clean or has been recently replaced, you will still continue to get this message at different intervals as a friendly reminder to look after your filter. Again, there is only a problem if you receive an F1 fault code as seen below

## Heat Light Turns Red

The heat light turning red is normal during heating operation on smart control models. This normally occurs 10-15 seconds after engaging the heater. You should notice the temperature of the spa water rising 1-2 degrees per hour when the heat light is red. Once the heater reaches its set temperature, the heater light will turn green, meaning it is not engaged but is in standby mode to heat when the water temperature falls below the set temp. On Frame series units with a top panel, the heater icon will be solidly lit when heating and will blink once set temperature is reached, showing that the heater is not engaged but is in standby mode. Please note that the unit will actually heat the water temperature approximately .5C OVER the set temp to create a small buffer so the heater is not constantly engaged to maintain the set temperature.

# Water Care

## Water Care Guide

Water Maintenance Made Easy MSpa maintenance must focus on chemical balance in your pool water, especially maintaining the pH in the ideal range 7.2 - 7.8. Failure to do so can result in catastrophic failure of the components in your MSpa control unit in as little as 3 months, costing hundreds of dollars. Product failure due to poor or incorrect water maintenance is NOT covered by warranty. To ensure your spa pool is always ready to use and for the health and wellbeing of everyone using your MSpa, it's essential to treat and balance the water so it stays clean, fresh, and inviting. You may have received a Starter Kit with your purchase, which is used alongside this guide. If not, you can purchase one from Portable Spas New Zealand. Successful water care consists of a simple startup procedure and an ongoing maintenance plan - we're here to help make it hassle-free. Water care requirements can vary based on the frequency of use and whether it's one, two or more people using the MSpa. With good filter maintenance and water management, you can change your water less frequently than traditional guidelines suggest. Make use of our new, easy Water Testing App for precise test results and suggestions. If you already have an idea about water maintenance, you can skip ahead to Section 2: Startup Guide. Contents Section 1 - Beginner's Guide to Water Treatment Section 2 - Simple Water Setup Guide Section 3 - No Hassle Water Care & Dosing Guide Section 4 - Essential Water Treatment Rules Section 5 - Draining & Refilling Guide Section 6 - Troubleshooting Section 7 - Spa Models & Water Capacities Section 1: Beginner's Guide to Water Treatment What is Water Treatment? Water treatment is the process of adding chemicals to your spa pool to keep it clean and safe to bathe in. Treatment has two main parts: sanitising and balancing - we'll keep things straightforward and easy. Sanitising the Water Sanitising means adding a disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) to kill bacteria. Without sanitiser, bacteria from bathers' bodies, oils, and dirt can quickly turn the water foul, smelly, and unsafe. Even if your spa has an ozone generator or UV system, these alone cannot fully sanitise the water. A small, regular dose of chlorine or bromine is essential - no mucking about here. Chlorine: Comes as a powder. Always dissolve chemicals before putting them in your MSpa - stir until no granules remain. If you are in a hurry, use hot water to dissolve the chemicals faster. Pour the dissolved chlorine into the MSpa and then run the bubbles for 5 minutes. Bromine: Comes as tablets, added to a floating dispenser that slowly releases sanitiser. Use one tablet per 400L of spa water to start. DO NOT MIX CHLORINE AND BROMINE. If you decide to switch from one to the other, please completely drain your MSpa and refill with fresh water before commencing treatment with the other sanitiser. Our spas are not compatible with silver products. Tip: For daily and more frequent use, add a teaspoon or two of dissolved chlorine each day (unless your chlorine levels are already high). For less frequent use, add chlorine in conjunction with your water testing - at least weekly. This keeps things simple. Balancing the Water Note that it can be easier to maintain your water balance, and extend the life of your filter cartridges if bathers have quick showers before using your MSpa. Especially if people use moisturisers, lotions, fake tans, sun screens, deodorants, perfumes etc, or if they are sweaty and dirty, a quick shower prior to using your MSpa should be compulsory. Beyond sanitising, you must balance three key factors: pH, Total Alkalinity (TA), and Calcium Hardness. Don't worry - it sounds more complicated than it is. pH Levels (7.2 - 7.8): Focus chemical management on maintaining the pH level in the ideal range between 7.2 and 7.8. Keeps water comfortable for eyes/skin and ensures sanitiser works effectively. Too high or too low can cause skin and eye irritation, corrosion within the control unit, or cloudy water. Total Alkalinity (80 - 120 PPM): Stabilises pH. Adjust TA first at startup to make balancing easier. Calcium Hardness (120 - 250 PPM): Too soft = corrosive water damaging spa parts. Too hard = scale buildup. Town supply water is usually in range but may need slight adjustment. Important: Add any other dissolved chemicals to get the water into the ideal ranges for pH, alkalinity, hardness etc before adding chlorine. Chlorine works best when the water is balanced. Other Regular Maintenance Shock Dosing (Chlorine users): Every fortnight and immediately after heavy use, dissolve Spa Chlor in a bucket and add with bubbles running. Filter Cleaning: Check weekly, wash thoroughly with a hose, replace with new filter cartridges every 4-6 weeks. Dirty filters can cause flow errors (E1/F1). General Cleaning: Wipe away grime, debris, and waterline scum. Always have a quick shower before using your MSpa, especially if you are dirty, sweaty, covered in sunscreen, fake tans, lotions, moisturiser or other products that could cause a change to the water chemical composition. This will also help your filter management - and it's good as gold for keeping your spa in top condition. Section 2: Simple 8-Step Spa Startup Guide Assemble and inflate your MSpa Fill spa with a hose to between the minimum and maximum levels (see manual). Turn power on, set temperature, press heater. Add sanitiser: Chlorine: Shock dose with Spa Chlor OR Bromine: Add tablets to floater (1 per 400L), aim for 3-5 PPM Run bubbles for 20 minutes with cover off to mix and vent. Replace cover and allow spa to heat. After 24 hours, test pH and TA, balance if needed and if needed, test again in a day or two Enjoy your spa! Test calcium hardness after 1-2 days and adjust if required. You can start enjoying your MSpa as soon as the water is at your desired temperature. Getting the water balanced can be a bit of a challenge for the first 7 - 10 days. Thereafter the teaspoon or so of chemicals that you need to add whenever you test the water becomes more consistent. After the initial set-up, unless you are not using your MSpa at all, the water should be tested and treated at least once per week. If you are using your MSpa less than weekly, test and balance your water after your spa, and the water should be ok without testing for 2 or 3 weeks, especially if you put your MSpa into standby mode. Section 3: No Hassle Water Care & Dosing Guide A suggested schedule for a family of three using the spa three times weekly - hassle-free and straightforward: Startup - Balance water per guidelines. Weekly - Add sanitiser after use, test pH & TA. Fortnightly - Shock dose. Every 3-4 months - Drain, clean or replace the filter cartridge, clean the insides of the inlet and outlet valves. Especially if there was any gunk in the valves or powdery residue in the pipes, remove the control unit from the MSpa and flush it with a hose from the inlet to the outlet pipes. Refill (or less frequently with good maintenance - see Section 4). Key Products in Starter Kits Chlorine Kit: Spa Chlor, Calcium Hardener, pH Buffer, pH Decrease, Test Strips. Bromine Kit: Bromine Tablets, Calcium Hardener, pH Buffer, pH Increase, Test Strips. Additional Helpful Products Spa Shock (oxidiser for heavy use/cloudy water) Crystal Clear (clarifier for cloudy water) No Foam (anti-foam for detergent/oil buildup) Algaecide (kills algae) Using Test Strips Turn off bubbles. Dip strip horizontally in the spa water for a few seconds, flick excess water. Within 10 seconds the test strip colours should make for easy comparison against the colour chart on the bottle. If colours fall between chart ranges, use the higher reading for safety. Record results, add chemicals accordingly. Note: Chemicals don't result in instant changes to your water balance. Wait 24 hours before retesting. Example Readings Low Calcium (100 PPM): Add Calcium Hardener. High pH (9.0): Add pH Decrease. TA in Range (120 PPM): No action required. Important: Chemical treatment should rarely require more than 2 teaspoons of any chemical, apart from the fortnightly chlorine shock dose. Section 4: Essential Water Treatment Rules Follow these essential rules for optimal water care. Water Treatment Guidelines: Use chemicals or completely drain and replace the water every 3 days if not maintaining proper chemical balance. Have a quick shower before using your MSpa, especially if you are dirty, sweaty, covered in sunscreen, fake tan, lotions, moisturiser or other products that could cause a change to the water chemical composition. This will also help your filter management. Test your water at least weekly. The only exceptions to this are if you use your MSpa less than once per week or you are not using your MSpa at all. For both scenarios before commencing a period of less frequent water testing, please ensure the filter cartridge is new or near new and clean, that the pH is in the ideal range and use a slow-release chemical dispenser with chlorine shock dose pill(s). Focus chemical management on maintaining the pH level in the ideal range between 7.2 and 7.8. Dissolve chemicals before putting them in your MSpa - stir until no granules remain. If you are in a hurry, use hot water to dissolve the chemicals faster. Chemical treatment should never require more than 2 teaspoons of any chemical, apart from the fortnightly chlorine shock dose. This prevents over-dosing which can damage your spa and irritate skin. Unless your chlorine levels are already high, for daily and more frequent use, add a teaspoon or two of chlorine each day. For less frequent use, add chlorine in conjunction with your water testing - at least weekly. Add any other chemicals to get the water into the ideal ranges for pH, alkalinity, hardness etc before adding chlorine. Chlorine works best when the water is balanced. Special Note for Rain / Tank Water Users Especially for those MSpa users that are on tank water supply, you need not drain and refill your MSpa every 3 months. With good water filter and control unit maintenance, you can change your water less frequently. When maintaining the water balance becomes difficult, it's then time to drain and refill your MSpa. Please note that there are no exceptions to the use of chemicals. If you are on rain water / tank water supply, you must still balance your water with chemicals, or be prepared to completely drain and refill your MSpa every 3 days. Section 5: Draining & Refilling Guide Drain every 3-4 months (or less frequently with excellent maintenance - see Section 4). Turn off power, drain via valve/hose, sponge out remaining water. Clean shell with mild soap and microfibre cloth. Clean inlet and outlet valves. If gunk or scale is evident, then also clean the pipes between the pool and the control unit and flush the control unit with a hose running the water into the inlet pipe so it flows out the outlet pipe.. Wash or replace the filter cartridge.. Refill and restart using the Section 2 guide. Section 6: Troubleshooting If you run into any issues, here's how to get things sorted: Cloudy Water: Clean filter, balance pH/TA, shock dose, add clarifier. Discoloured/Smelly Water: Indicates bacteria buildup. Increase sanitiser, shock dose twice if needed. If your MSpa has the UVC feature, please note that this can be run 24x7 and if it has Ozone, running this after each spa helps kill bacteria. Foamy Water: Caused by oils/detergents. Shower before use, skim foam, add anti-foam if needed. Skin/Eye Irritation: Caused by poor pH balance or sanitiser imbalance. Balance water, adjust sanitiser. Scum Line: Caused by oils, lotions, makeup, or high calcium. Clean regularly, shower before spa use. Floating Debris: Clean filter, skim with cleaning kit net, shock dose, flush system if persistent. Excess Algae: Use algaecide, repeat if necessary and as above use the UVC and Ozone features if available in your MSpa. When to contact us: If water stays cloudy after following these steps, if you're using more chemicals than recommended, or if problems persist after 48 hours, give us a call. We're here to help - you can count on us to get you back to enjoying your MSpa. Section 7: Spa Models & Water Capacities Refer to your spa's manual for exact litre capacity to ensure correct dosing.

What Causes Limescale? Limescale develops when the pH of the water is left consistently higher than the pH OK Range of the test strips. The high pH causes any calcium in the water to crystallise, which normally happens within the heater due to the reduced surface area inside the heater. If left unchecked, scale will continue to form and will eventually choke the heater completely. Detecting Limescale Scale can often be detected visually by noticing white "flakes" in the water, usually on the floor of the spa underneath the outlet or within the outlet grill. Many people mistake this for chemicals which did not fully dissolve. You may also notice a white chalky buildup on the spa walls. If you believe you may have limescale, an easy thing to check is the inlets and outlets on the control unit. These will generally have a chalky white residue all around if limescale is present. Inspecting the Heater If you want to go one step further, grab the 3 grey threaded caps that came with the spa and screw into the inlet, outlet and bubbler line (the bubbler cap connects on the outside of the spa). This will save you from losing all of your spa water. Now undo the three grey collars connecting the control unit to the spa. Pull the control unit away from the spa far enough to give yourself enough room to easily access the back flat panel. Unscrew the 5 back panel screws and you will have a good view of the heater. Look at where the metal meets the plastic. If the heater is full of limescale, you will usually see the scale forcing its way out of the heater seam. Please note that for customers with a smart control unit, the spa would first need to be drained and then removed from the shell to access the heater. Effects of Limescale on Your Control Unit Limescale can have a number of undesirable effects on your control unit: Flow Restriction and Errors As the scale continues to form, flow becomes restricted through the heater and the flow switches detect a problem. To avoid damaging the system, the control unit will start to present flow errors such as E1 or F1. Reduced Heating Efficiency Because limescale coats the inside of the heater element, output from the heater is reduced. This can lead to increased times to heat the spa water to the set temperature and therefore increased electrical bills. Heater High Limit Activation You may also come out to your spa and discover the water is much colder than the temperature you had set and doesn't appear to be heating at all, even though the heat icon is illuminated. Because of restricted flow and a scale coated element, the internal temperature of the heater can quickly reach 45&deg;C. This causes the heater high limit to activate to avoid causing severe internal damage to the system. The heat icon will remain on but the heater has disengaged itself from the active circuit, meaning no power is going to the heater. The yellow cord rest will need to be pulled to reset the heater's high limit function. This is only a temporary fix as the high limit will again soon activate because the scale buildup is causing the heater to overheat. If your heater has recently been replaced, you will notice that there is no longer a yellow pull cord. This is because replacement heaters now have a built in reset. If the heater becomes too hot internally (45&deg;C) it will disengage itself from the active circuit to avoid damaging the system. The heat icon will remain on, however, and appear to be heating but no power is actually going to the heater. Once the temperature inside the heater cools below 45&deg;C, it will re-engage the active and begin heating again as required. This eliminates the need for a manual reset. Complete Heater Failure Lastly, because the heater is working so hard and trying to heat through a coat of limescale, it will eventually fail completely. This will result in the RCD tripping every time the heater is engaged. Prevention is Key The best way to prevent scale from forming in your control unit and spa is to test and balance your water at least weekly. Pay close attention to the pH and add appropriate chemicals as required to keep the pH in the OK Range. Limescale is a watercare issue and is therefore not covered under warranty, so it becomes a costly experience that could have been avoided with weekly water testing and balancing. Should you have limescale, you would be responsible for all costs associated with getting the control unit to and from our technical team in Christchurch, technician time of one hour and cost of a replacement heater. Caution: Avoid Overcorrecting pH If you have had limescale in the past or are afraid of getting limescale, be sure not to intentionally keep the pH below the OK Range on your test strips. A low pH causes the spa water to become acidic and therefore corrosive. In addition to causing problems with the heater, a pH too low or too high outside of the OK Range will also damage other components such as the filter pump, cause seals to leak and will damage the spa shell itself. Treating Existing Limescale If you start to see limescale, aside from testing and balancing your water, it's a good idea to purchase a descaling chemical from a local pool and spa shop. Be sure it is rated for spas and not just for pools. White Vinegar Treatment Method Several of our customers have had success with running white vinegar through their systems to remove the buildup. Depending on the severity of the scale, this may or may not work for you. To do this: Disconnect or remove the control unit from the spa (depending on your model) Lay the unit on its back so the inlet, outlet and bubbler outlet are facing up Pour 1 litre of white vinegar into the heater outlet. This is the lower opening on the left (NOT THE BOTTOM CENTRAL OPENING WHICH IS THE BUBBLER) Allow to sit for 2-4 hours Stand unit upright and place garden hose in front of inlet (top right opening) and turn on. DO NOT USE A HIGH PRESSURE NOZZLE AS THIS CAN DAMAGE THE FLOW SWITCH If the vinegar has broken down the scale, you should see white "gunk" being forced out of the lower outlet. Continue flushing until water from outlet becomes clear Once water is clear, continue flushing for an additional 2 minutes. This ensures all of the vinegar is flushed from the system. If not flushed long enough, residual vinegar will enter your spa water and wreak havoc on your pH Reconnect or re-install control unit and run as per normal operation Additional Resources For more information regarding water balancing and amount of chemicals to add, please see the Updated Portable Spas Water Care Guide.
