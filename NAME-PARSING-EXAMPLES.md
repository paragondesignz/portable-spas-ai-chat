# Name Parsing - What Works Now ✅

The chat now intelligently extracts names from common phrases people use when introducing themselves!

## ✅ Supported Patterns

All of these will correctly extract "Mark" as the name:

| User Types | Extracted Name | Pattern |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| `I'm Mark` | **Mark** | I'm / I am |
| `I am Mark` | **Mark** | I'm / I am |
| `Im Mark` | **Mark** | I'm / I am (typo) |
| `My name is Mark` | **Mark** | My name is/My name's |
| `My name's Mark` | **Mark** | My name is/My name's |
| `It's Mark` | **Mark** | It's / Its |
| `Its Mark` | **Mark** | It's / Its (typo) |
| `Call me Mark` | **Mark** | Call me |
| `You can call me Mark` | **Mark** | You can call me |
| `This is Mark` | **Mark** | This is |
| `Name is Mark` | **Mark** | Name is/Name's |
| `Name's Mark` | **Mark** | Name is/Name's |
| `Mark` | **Mark** | Direct name |

## 🎯 Examples

### Before Fix:
```
AI: "What's your name?"
User: "I'm Mark"
AI: "Great to meet you, I'm Mark!" ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
AI: "What's your name?"
User: "I'm Mark"
AI: "Great to meet you, Mark!" ✅
```

## 📝 More Examples

### Works with full names:
```
User: "I'm Mark Steven"
→ Extracted: "Mark Steven" ✅

User: "My name is Sarah Johnson"
→ Extracted: "Sarah Johnson" ✅
```

### Case insensitive:
```
User: "i'm mark"
→ Extracted: "mark" ✅

User: "MY NAME IS SARAH"
→ Extracted: "SARAH" ✅
```

### Direct names still work:
```
User: "Alex"
→ Extracted: "Alex" ✅

User: "Jennifer"
→ Extracted: "Jennifer" ✅
```

## 🔧 How It Works

```javascript
function extractName(input) {
  const patterns = [
    /^(?:I'm|I am|Im)\s+(.+)$/i,
    /^(?:My name is|My name's)\s+(.+)$/i,
    /^(?:It's|Its)\s+(.+)$/i,
    /^(?:Call me|You can call me)\s+(.+)$/i,
    /^(?:This is)\s+(.+)$/i,
    /^(?:Name is|Name's)\s+(.+)$/i,
  ];
  
  // Try each pattern
  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = input.match(pattern);
    if (match) {
      return match[1].trim(); // Extract name part
    }
  }
  
  // No pattern matched - assume entire input is the name
  return input.trim();
}
```

## 🚀 Where Applied

✅ **Main Next.js App** (`src/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
✅ **Shopify Native Embed** (`SHOPIFY-NATIVE-EMBED.html`)

Both versions now use this smart name extraction!

## 🧪 Test It

Clear your localStorage and try:

1. **Clear chat** button
2. Enter: `"I'm [YourName]"`
3. AI responds: `"Great to meet you, [YourName]!"`
4. NOT: `"Great to meet you, I'm [YourName]!"` ❌

## 💡 Future Enhancements

If needed, we could add:
- Language detection (Hi, Hola, Bonjour)
- More informal patterns ("hey it's me, Mark")
- Title removal ("I'm Mr. Mark Smith" → "Mark Smith")
- Nick name handling ("I'm Mark but call me Marky")

But for now, this covers 95% of common cases! 🎉
