We are terribly sorry you are experiencing a flow error with your control unit.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The heating unit will default to an E1 or F1 error if it detects a blockage or decreased flow within the system as a way of protecting itself to avoid severe internal damage. Often this is because the filters are dirty and/or need replacing. Filters need to be cleaned at least weekly and replaced with new every 4-6 weeks. Recycling filters will not work as the paper pleats break down over time, restricting flow. When you are cleaning the filter we would also recommend cleaning the filter grills thoroughly as sometimes these can collect debris that the filter doesn&rsquo;t always catch.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Please try the following for an E1 or F1 error:</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Firstly, power up the unit and press the filter button only. If you can't hear the pump running before the error appears or if it sounds louder than normal or unusual, there is an issue with the filter pump.

With filter grills removed, it is also a good idea to look inside the inlet and outlet at the hanging ""flappers""- these are the flow switches. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">See if any lint, hair, etc has made its way through the system and is interfering with the flow switches working properly as seen below.

"Water Care Guide","water-care-guide","<h1><strong>Water Maintenance Made Easy</strong></h1> <p>MSpa maintenance must focus on chemical balance in your pool water, especially maintaining the pH in the ideal range 7.2 - 7.8. Failure to do so can result in catastrophic failure of the components in your MSpa control unit in as little as 3 months, costing hundreds of dollars. Product failure due to poor or incorrect water maintenance is NOT covered by warranty.&nbsp;</p> <p>To ensure your spa pool is always ready to use and for the health and wellbeing of everyone using your MSpa, it's essential to treat and balance the water so it stays clean, fresh, and inviting.</p> <p>You may have received a Starter Kit with your purchase, which is used alongside this guide. If not, you can purchase one from Portable Spas New Zealand. Successful water care consists of a simple startup procedure and an ongoing maintenance plan &ndash; we're here to help make it hassle-free.</p> <p>Water care requirements can vary based on the frequency of use and whether it's one, two or more people using the MSpa. With good filter maintenance and water management, you can change your water less frequently than traditional guidelines suggest.</p> <p>Make use of our new, easy <a href=""https://portablespas.co.nz/pages/water-testing-app"">Water Testing App</a>&nbsp;for precise test results and suggestions.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you already have an idea about water maintenance, you can skip ahead to <strong>Section 2: Startup Guide.</strong></p> <h3><strong>Contents</strong></h3> <p><strong>Section 1</strong> &ndash; Beginner's Guide to Water Treatment <br /><strong>Section 2</strong> &ndash; Simple Water Setup Guide <br /><strong>Section 3</strong> &ndash; No Hassle Water Care &amp; Dosing Guide <br /><strong>Section 4</strong> &ndash; Essential Water Treatment Rules <br /><strong>Section 5</strong> &ndash; Draining &amp; Refilling Guide <br /><strong>Section 6</strong> &ndash; Troubleshooting <br /><strong>Section 7</strong> &ndash; Spa Models &amp; Water Capacities</p> <h2><strong>Section 1: Beginner's Guide to Water Treatment</strong></h2> <h3><strong>What is Water Treatment?</strong></h3> <p>Water treatment is the process of adding chemicals to your spa pool to keep it clean and safe to bathe in. Treatment has two main parts: <strong>sanitising</strong> and <strong>balancing</strong> &ndash; we'll keep things straightforward and easy.</p> <h3><strong>Sanitising the Water</strong></h3> <p>Sanitising means adding a disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) to kill bacteria. Without sanitiser, bacteria from bathers' bodies, oils, and dirt can quickly turn the water foul, smelly, and unsafe. Even if your spa has an ozone generator or UV system, these alone cannot fully sanitise the water. A small, regular dose of chlorine or bromine is essential &ndash; no mucking about here.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Chlorine</strong>: Comes as a powder. Always dissolve chemicals before putting them in your MSpa &ndash; stir until no granules remain. If you are in a hurry, use hot water to dissolve the chemicals faster. Pour the dissolved chlorine into the MSpa and then run the bubbles for 5 minutes.</li> <li><strong>Bromine</strong>: Comes as tablets, added to a floating dispenser that slowly releases sanitiser. Use one tablet per 400L of spa water to start.</li> </ul> <p><span style=""color: #e03e2d;""><strong>DO NOT MIX CHLORINE AND BROMINE. </strong></span>If you decide to switch from one to the other, please completely drain your MSpa and refill with fresh water before commencing treatment with the other sanitiser.</p> <p>Our spas are not compatible with silver products.</p> <p>Tip: For daily and more frequent use, add a teaspoon or two of dissolved chlorine each day (unless your chlorine levels are already high). For less frequent use, add chlorine in conjunction with your water testing - at least weekly. This keeps things simple.</p> <h3><strong>Balancing the Water</strong></h3> <p>Note that it can be easier to maintain your water balance, and extend the life of your filter cartridges if bathers have quick showers before using your MSpa. Especially if people use moisturisers, lotions, fake tans, sun screens, deodorants, perfumes etc, or if they are sweaty and dirty, a quick shower prior to using your MSpa should be compulsory.</p> <p>Beyond sanitising, you must balance three key factors: <strong>pH, Total Alkalinity (TA), and Calcium Hardness.</strong> Don't worry &ndash; it sounds more complicated than it is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>pH Levels (7.2 &ndash; 7.8):</strong> Focus chemical management on maintaining the pH level in the ideal range between 7.2 and 7.8. Keeps water comfortable for eyes/skin and ensures sanitiser works effectively. Too high or too low can cause skin and eye irritation, corrosion&nbsp; within the control unit, or cloudy water.</li> <li><strong>Total Alkalinity (80 &ndash; 120 PPM):</strong> Stabilises pH. Adjust TA first at startup to make balancing easier.</li> <li><strong>Calcium Hardness (120 &ndash; 250 PPM):</strong> Too soft = corrosive water damaging spa parts. Too hard = scale buildup. Town supply water is usually in range but may need slight adjustment.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Important:</strong> Add any other dissolved chemicals to get the water into the ideal ranges for pH, alkalinity, hardness etc before adding chlorine. Chlorine works best when the water is balanced.</p> <h3><strong>Other Regular Maintenance</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Shock Dosing (Chlorine users):</strong> Every fortnight and immediately after heavy use, dissolve Spa Chlor in a bucket and add with bubbles running.</li> <li><strong>Filter Cleaning:</strong> Check weekly, wash thoroughly with a hose, replace with new filter cartridges every 4&ndash;6 weeks. Dirty filters can cause flow errors (E1/F1).</li> <li><strong>General Cleaning:</strong> Wipe away grime, debris, and waterline scum. <strong>Always have a quick shower before using your MSpa, especially if you are dirty, sweaty, covered in sunscreen, fake tans, lotions, moisturiser or other products that could cause a change to the water chemical composition.</strong> This will also help your filter management &ndash; and it's good as gold for keeping your spa in top condition.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Section 2: Simple 8-Step Spa Startup Guide</strong></h2> <ol> <li>Assemble and inflate your MSpa</li> <li>Fill spa with a hose to between the minimum and maximum levels (see manual).</li> <li>Turn power on, set temperature, press heater.</li> <li>Add sanitiser:<br /><br /></li> <ul> <li><strong>Chlorine</strong>: Shock dose with Spa Chlor <span style=""color: #e03e2d;""><strong>OR</strong></span></li> <li><strong>Bromine</strong>: Add tablets to floater (1 per 400L), aim for 3&ndash;5 PPM<br /><br /></li> </ul> <li>Run bubbles for 20 minutes with cover off to mix and vent.</li> <li>Replace cover and allow spa to heat.</li> <li>After 24 hours, test pH and TA, balance if needed and if needed, test again in a day or two</li> <li>Enjoy your spa! Test calcium hardness after 1&ndash;2 days and adjust if required.</li> </ol> <p>You can start enjoying your MSpa as soon as the water is at your desired temperature. Getting the water balanced can be a bit of a challenge for the first 7 - 10 days. Thereafter the teaspoon or so of chemicals that you need to add whenever you test the water becomes more consistent.</p> <p>After the initial set-up, unless you are not using your MSpa at all, the water should be tested and treated at least once per week. If you are using your MSpa less than weekly, test and balance your water after your spa, and the water should be ok without testing for 2 or 3 weeks, especially if you put your MSpa into standby mode.</p> <p><strong>Section 3: No Hassle Water Care &amp; Dosing Guide</strong></p> <p>A suggested schedule for a family of three using the spa three times weekly &ndash; hassle-free and straightforward:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Startup</strong> &ndash; Balance water per guidelines.</li> <li><strong>Weekly</strong> &ndash; Add sanitiser after use, test pH &amp; TA.</li> <li><strong>Fortnightly</strong> &ndash; Shock dose.</li> <li><strong>Every 3&ndash;4 months</strong> &ndash; Drain, clean or replace the filter cartridge, clean the insides of the inlet and outlet valves. Especially if there was any gunk in the valves or powdery residue in the pipes, remove the control unit from the MSpa and flush it with a hose from the inlet to the outlet pipes. Refill (or less frequently with good maintenance - see Section 4).</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Key Products in Starter Kits</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Chlorine Kit</strong>: Spa Chlor, Calcium Hardener, pH Buffer, pH Decrease, Test Strips.</li> <li><strong>Bromine Kit</strong>: Bromine Tablets, Calcium Hardener, pH Buffer, pH Increase, Test Strips.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Additional Helpful Products</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Spa Shock</strong> (oxidiser for heavy use/cloudy water)</li> <li><strong>Crystal Clear</strong> (clarifier for cloudy water)</li> <li><strong>No Foam</strong> (anti-foam for detergent/oil buildup)</li> <li><strong>Algaecide</strong> (kills algae)</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Using Test Strips</strong></h3> <ol> <li>Turn off bubbles.</li> <li>Dip strip horizontally in the spa water for a few seconds, flick excess water.</li> <li>Within 10 seconds the test strip colours should make for easy comparison against the colour chart on the bottle.</li> <li>If colours fall between chart ranges, use the higher reading for safety.</li> <li>Record results, add chemicals accordingly.</li> </ol> <p>Note: Chemicals don't result in instant changes to your water balance. Wait 24 hours before retesting.</p> <h3><strong>Example Readings</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Low Calcium (100 PPM):</strong> Add Calcium Hardener.</li> <li><strong>High pH (9.0):</strong> Add pH Decrease.</li> <li><strong>TA in Range (120 PPM):</strong> No action required.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Important:</strong> Chemical treatment should rarely require more than 2 teaspoons of any chemical, apart from the fortnightly chlorine shock dose.</p> <h2><strong>Section 4: Essential Water Treatment Rules</strong></h2> <p>Follow these essential rules for optimal water care.</p> <h3><strong>Water Treatment Guidelines:</strong></h3> <ol> <li><strong>Use chemicals or completely drain and replace the water every 3 days</strong> if not maintaining proper chemical balance.</li> <li><strong>Have a quick shower before using your MSpa</strong>, especially if you are dirty, sweaty, covered in sunscreen, fake tan, lotions, moisturiser or other products that could cause a change to the water chemical composition. This will also help your filter management.</li> <li><strong>Test your water at least weekly.</strong> The only exceptions to this are if you use your MSpa less than once per week or you are not using your MSpa at all. For both scenarios before commencing a period of less frequent water testing, please ensure the filter cartridge is new or near new and clean, that the pH is in the ideal range and use a slow-release chemical dispenser with chlorine shock dose pill(s).</li> <li><strong>Focus chemical management on maintaining the pH level in the ideal range between 7.2 and 7.8.</strong><strong><br /></strong></li> <li><strong>Dissolve chemicals before putting them in your MSpa</strong> &ndash; stir until no granules remain. If you are in a hurry, use hot water to dissolve the chemicals faster.</li> <li><strong>Chemical treatment should never require more than 2 teaspoons of any chemical</strong>, apart from the fortnightly chlorine shock dose. This prevents over-dosing which can damage your spa and irritate skin.</li> <li><strong>Unless your chlorine levels are already high, for daily and more frequent use, add a teaspoon or two of chlorine each day.</strong> For less frequent use, add chlorine in conjunction with your water testing - at least weekly.</li> <li><strong>Add any other chemicals to get the water into the ideal ranges for pH, alkalinity, hardness etc before adding chlorine.</strong> Chlorine works best when the water is balanced.</li> </ol> <h3><strong>Special Note for Rain / Tank Water Users</strong></h3> <p>Especially for those MSpa users that are on tank water supply, you need not drain and refill your MSpa every 3 months. With good water filter and control unit maintenance, you can change your water less frequently. When maintaining the water balance becomes difficult, it's then time to drain and refill your MSpa.</p> <p>Please note that there are no exceptions to the use of chemicals. If you are on rain water / tank water supply, you must still balance your water with chemicals, or be prepared to completely drain and refill your MSpa every 3 days.</p> <h2><strong>Section 5: Draining &amp; Refilling Guide</strong></h2> <ul> <li>Drain every <strong>3&ndash;4 months</strong> (or less frequently with excellent maintenance - see Section 4).</li> <li>Turn off power, drain via valve/hose, sponge out remaining water.</li> <li>Clean shell with mild soap and microfibre cloth.</li> <li>Clean inlet and outlet valves. If gunk or scale is evident, then also clean the pipes between the pool and the control unit and flush the control unit with a hose running the water into the inlet pipe so it flows out the outlet pipe..</li> <li>Wash or replace the filter cartridge..</li> <li>Refill and restart using the Section 2 guide.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Section 6: Troubleshooting</strong></h2> <p>If you run into any issues, here's how to get things sorted:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cloudy Water:</strong> Clean filter, balance pH/TA, shock dose, add clarifier.</li> <li><strong>Discoloured/Smelly Water:</strong> Indicates bacteria buildup. Increase sanitiser, shock dose twice if needed. If your MSpa has the UVC feature, please note that this can be run 24x7 and if it has Ozone, running this after each spa helps kill bacteria.</li> <li><strong>Foamy Water:</strong> Caused by oils/detergents. Shower before use, skim foam, add anti-foam if needed.</li> <li><strong>Skin/Eye Irritation:</strong> Caused by poor pH balance or sanitiser imbalance. Balance water, adjust sanitiser.</li> <li><strong>Scum Line:</strong> Caused by oils, lotions, makeup, or high calcium. Clean regularly, shower before spa use.</li> <li><strong>Floating Debris:</strong> Clean filter, skim with cleaning kit net, shock dose, flush system if persistent.</li> <li><strong>Excess Algae:</strong> Use algaecide, repeat if necessary and as above use the UVC and Ozone features if available in your MSpa.</li> </ul> <p><strong>When to contact us:</strong> If water stays cloudy after following these steps, if you're using more chemicals than recommended, or if problems persist after 48 hours, give us a call. We're here to help &ndash; you can count on us to get you back to enjoying your MSpa.</p> <h2><strong>Section 7: Spa Models &amp; Water Capacities</strong></h2> <p>Refer to your spa's manual for exact litre capacity to ensure correct dosing.

"Limescale Prevention and Treatment Guide","limescale-prevention-and-treatment-guide","<h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">What Causes Limescale?</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Limescale develops when the pH of the water is left consistently higher than the pH OK Range of the test strips. The high pH causes any calcium in the water to crystallise, which normally happens within the heater due to the reduced surface area inside the heater. If left unchecked, scale will continue to form and will eventually choke the heater completely.</p> <p><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12115/mceu_70677652711758504573637.webp"" width=""300"" /></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Detecting Limescale</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Scale can often be detected visually by noticing white ""flakes"" in the water, usually on the floor of the spa underneath the outlet or within the outlet grill. Many people mistake this for chemicals which did not fully dissolve. You may also notice a white chalky buildup on the spa walls.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you believe you may have limescale, an easy thing to check is the inlets and outlets on the control unit. These will generally have a chalky white residue all around if limescale is present.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Inspecting the Heater</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you want to go one step further, grab the 3 grey threaded caps that came with the spa and screw into the inlet, outlet and bubbler line (the bubbler cap connects on the outside of the spa). This will save you from losing all of your spa water. Now undo the three grey collars connecting the control unit to the spa. Pull the control unit away from the spa far enough to give yourself enough room to easily access the back flat panel. Unscrew the 5 back panel screws and you will have a good view of the heater. Look at where the metal meets the plastic. If the heater is full of limescale, you will usually see the scale forcing its way out of the heater seam.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Please note that for customers with a smart control unit, the spa would first need to be drained and then removed from the shell to access the heater.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFKHC6X8s-Y"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></span></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Effects of Limescale on Your Control Unit</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Limescale can have a number of undesirable effects on your control unit:</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Flow Restriction and Errors</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">As the scale continues to form, flow becomes restricted through the heater and the flow switches detect a problem. To avoid damaging the system, the control unit will start to present flow errors such as E1 or F1.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Reduced Heating Efficiency</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Because limescale coats the inside of the heater element, output from the heater is reduced. This can lead to increased times to heat the spa water to the set temperature and therefore increased electrical bills.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Heater High Limit Activation</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">You may also come out to your spa and discover the water is much colder than the temperature you had set and doesn't appear to be heating at all, even though the heat icon is illuminated. Because of restricted flow and a scale coated element, the internal temperature of the heater can quickly reach 45&deg;C. This causes the heater high limit to activate to avoid causing severe internal damage to the system. The heat icon will remain on but the heater has disengaged itself from the active circuit, meaning no power is going to the heater. The yellow cord rest will need to be pulled to reset the heater's high limit function.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">This is only a temporary fix as the high limit will again soon activate because the scale buildup is causing the heater to overheat.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If your heater has recently been replaced, you will notice that there is no longer a yellow pull cord. This is because replacement heaters now have a built in reset. If the heater becomes too hot internally (45&deg;C) it will disengage itself from the active circuit to avoid damaging the system. The heat icon will remain on, however, and appear to be heating but no power is actually going to the heater. Once the temperature inside the heater cools below 45&deg;C, it will re-engage the active and begin heating again as required. This eliminates the need for a manual reset.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12116/mceu_25567432821758504622042.webp"" width=""300"" /></span></p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Complete Heater Failure</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Lastly, because the heater is working so hard and trying to heat through a coat of limescale, it will eventually fail completely. This will result in the RCD tripping every time the heater is engaged.</p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Prevention is Key</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">The best way to prevent scale from forming in your control unit and spa is to test and balance your water at least weekly. Pay close attention to the pH and add appropriate chemicals as required to keep the pH in the OK Range.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Limescale is a watercare issue and is therefore not covered under warranty, so it becomes a costly experience that could have been avoided with weekly water testing and balancing. Should you have limescale, you would be responsible for all costs associated with getting the control unit to and from our technical team in Christchurch, technician time of one hour and cost of a replacement heater.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12117/mceu_78460601431758504683792.webp"" width=""400"" /></span></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Caution: Avoid Overcorrecting pH</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you have had limescale in the past or are afraid of getting limescale, be sure not to intentionally keep the pH below the OK Range on your test strips. A low pH causes the spa water to become acidic and therefore corrosive.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">In addition to causing problems with the heater, a pH too low or too high outside of the OK Range will also damage other components such as the filter pump, cause seals to leak and will damage the spa shell itself.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12118/mceu_62175489141758504723948.webp"" width=""400"" /></span></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Treating Existing Limescale</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you start to see limescale, aside from testing and balancing your water, it's a good idea to purchase a descaling chemical from a local pool and spa shop. Be sure it is rated for spas and not just for pools.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">White Vinegar Treatment Method</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Several of our customers have had success with running white vinegar through their systems to remove the buildup. Depending on the severity of the scale, this may or may not work for you. To do this:</p> <ol class=""[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-decimal space-y-1.5 pl-7""> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Disconnect or remove the control unit from the spa (depending on your model)</li> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Lay the unit on its back so the inlet, outlet and bubbler outlet are facing up</li> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Pour 1 litre of white vinegar into the heater outlet. This is the lower opening on the left (NOT THE BOTTOM CENTRAL OPENING WHICH IS THE BUBBLER)</li> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Allow to sit for 2-4 hours</li> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Stand unit upright and place garden hose in front of inlet (top right opening) and turn on. DO NOT USE A HIGH PRESSURE NOZZLE AS THIS CAN DAMAGE THE FLOW SWITCH</li> <li class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If the vinegar has broken down the scale, you should see white ""gunk"" being forced out of the lower outlet.

The high pH causes any calcium in the water to crystallise, which normally happens within the heater due to the reduced surface area inside the heater. If left unchecked, scale will continue to form and will eventually choke the heater completely.</p> <p><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12115/mceu_70677652711758504573637.webp"" width=""300"" /></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Detecting Limescale</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Scale can often be detected visually by noticing white ""flakes"" in the water, usually on the floor of the spa underneath the outlet or within the outlet grill. Many people mistake this for chemicals which did not fully dissolve. You may also notice a white chalky buildup on the spa walls.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you believe you may have limescale, an easy thing to check is the inlets and outlets on the control unit. These will generally have a chalky white residue all around if limescale is present.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Inspecting the Heater</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If you want to go one step further, grab the 3 grey threaded caps that came with the spa and screw into the inlet, outlet and bubbler line (the bubbler cap connects on the outside of the spa). This will save you from losing all of your spa water. Now undo the three grey collars connecting the control unit to the spa. Pull the control unit away from the spa far enough to give yourself enough room to easily access the back flat panel. Unscrew the 5 back panel screws and you will have a good view of the heater. Look at where the metal meets the plastic. If the heater is full of limescale, you will usually see the scale forcing its way out of the heater seam.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Please note that for customers with a smart control unit, the spa would first need to be drained and then removed from the shell to access the heater.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFKHC6X8s-Y"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></span></p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Effects of Limescale on Your Control Unit</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Limescale can have a number of undesirable effects on your control unit:</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Flow Restriction and Errors</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">As the scale continues to form, flow becomes restricted through the heater and the flow switches detect a problem. To avoid damaging the system, the control unit will start to present flow errors such as E1 or F1.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Reduced Heating Efficiency</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Because limescale coats the inside of the heater element, output from the heater is reduced. This can lead to increased times to heat the spa water to the set temperature and therefore increased electrical bills.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Heater High Limit Activation</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">You may also come out to your spa and discover the water is much colder than the temperature you had set and doesn't appear to be heating at all, even though the heat icon is illuminated. Because of restricted flow and a scale coated element, the internal temperature of the heater can quickly reach 45&deg;C. This causes the heater high limit to activate to avoid causing severe internal damage to the system. The heat icon will remain on but the heater has disengaged itself from the active circuit, meaning no power is going to the heater. The yellow cord rest will need to be pulled to reset the heater's high limit function.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">This is only a temporary fix as the high limit will again soon activate because the scale buildup is causing the heater to overheat.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If your heater has recently been replaced, you will notice that there is no longer a yellow pull cord. This is because replacement heaters now have a built in reset. If the heater becomes too hot internally (45&deg;C) it will disengage itself from the active circuit to avoid damaging the system. The heat icon will remain on, however, and appear to be heating but no power is actually going to the heater. Once the temperature inside the heater cools below 45&deg;C, it will re-engage the active and begin heating again as required. This eliminates the need for a manual reset.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/betterdocs-shopify-assets/12116/mceu_25567432821758504622042.webp"" width=""300"" /></span></p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Complete Heater Failure</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Lastly, because the heater is working so hard and trying to heat through a coat of limescale, it will eventually fail completely.

We are terribly sorry you are experiencing a heating issue with your control unit.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">Please try the following if your unit is running but is not heating or is losing heat:</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">● Turn power off to the unit either by going to your PRCD on the control box cord and pressing the test function or by switching off power to your unit at the wall.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">● Go to the heating unit and slide your hand underneath. Locate the yellow reset cord and pull it gently until it stops. You should hear a faint clicking sound which confirms the heater was reset.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">Here is a YouTube video showing the&nbsp;<a id=""isPasted"" style=""color: #d4af37;"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFKHC6X8s-Y"">yellow cord heater reset</a>.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""color: #d14841;""><strong>***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;""><strong>Pulling the cord too hard will force the reset arm off its hinge and will not reset the heater</strong></p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""color: #d14841;""><strong>***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING*** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***WARNING***&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">● Turn the switch at the wall back on to power the unit and/or go to the PRCD on the control box cord and press reset to turn your spa back on. Then press test to make sure it turns off. Press reset again. Operate spa as normal. You should notice the spa climbing in temperature approximately 1C - 1.5C per hour.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">Please note that if the heater needs to be reset, the internal temperature of the heater has reached 45C. If this happens, the heater reset pops, which means the heater disengages itself from the active circuit so as not to damage the system. Panel/Smart Control functions will appear normal but no power is being supplied to the heater. The biggest cause of the heater reset popping is dirty filters or filters over 6 weeks old as they restrict flow through the heater which in turn causes the internal temperature of the heater to get too hot.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">A water level below the inlet grill or people splashing in the pool can cause the system to intake air and can also result in the internal temperature of the heater exceeding 45C, therefore activating the heater high limit which will need to be reset.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">If your new spa out of the box is not heating, the yellow cord reset will likely correct the problem. The heater high limit can sometimes inadvertently activate during shipping due to the movement and vibration of being transported.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">If you think you have accidentally pulled the reset cord too hard, preventing the heater from resetting, you can easily check the reset arm for all Frame series spas&nbsp;<a style=""color: #d4af37;"" href=""https://youtu.be/aRnf-pVm0tI"">as shown here</a>. Please note that although a non-Frame control unit is used for the demo, the process is the same.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">For all spa models that have an internal control unit, you would first need to remove the control unit from the spa shell as shown below&nbsp;in order to check the reset arm.</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NY7GNmYfXEQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;""><strong>WHEN REMOVING THE CONTROL UNIT FROM THE SPA SHELL, BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL REMOVING THE WHITE ROTATION KNOB FROM THE UNIT. AFTER REMOVING THE SCREW HOLDING THE KNOB IN PLACE, GENTLY PULL OUTWARD WHILST GENTLY TURNING THE KNOB. IT WILL SLOWLY COME OUT. WHEN RE-INSERTING THE KNOB WHEN RE-INSTALLING CONTROL UNIT INTO SPA SHELL, VERY GENTLY PUSH INWARDS WHILST ROTATING THE KNOB. YOU WILL FEEL IT LOCK INTO PLACE. THEN TIGHTEN THE SCREW.&nbsp;</strong><span id=""isPasted"" style=""color: #b8312f;""><u><strong>THERE IS A VERY THIN MICROSWITCH UNDERNEATH THE HOLE THE KNOB FITS INTO. IF YOU FORCE THE KNOB IN OR OUT WHEN REMOVING OR RE-INSTALLING, YOU CAN DAMAGE THE MICROSWITCH. THIS WILL RESULT IN BUBBLER NOT WORKING AND THE MICROSWITCH WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.</strong></u></span></p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">If the unit continues to pop the heater reset and filters are clean and/or new, it is very possible you have limescale in the heater. Limescale is a crystalised buildup of calcium that develops when the pH is too high in the spa, so be sure to test your water weekly and adjust pH as required to stay within the ok range to avoid this happening again in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""color: #161616; font-size: 16px;"">If none of the above has corrected the problem or the reset continues to pop, possibly due to limescale, you will need to send your control unit only to our technical team in Christchurch to assess.

"How Much Should My Spa Running Costs Be?","how-much-should-my-spa-running-costs-be","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are a number of variables that will affect your spa's running cost. These include set temperature, how often you are running the bubbler, if are you keeping the spa covered and using the inflatable bladder when not in use, if you have a heat preservation mat underneath the spa and depending on the model, if you have a 1.5 kW or 2.2 kW heater.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On average, our customers report that our 6 man spa range costs roughly $5.00 per day to run in summer and closer to $7.00 per day in winter. These costs do not include the the 8 man Mono which has a greater water volume or the Oslo model which has an additional jet pump.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your first month of spa operation will have the highest energy cost and is not indicative of months to follow. This is because the spa initially has to heat the ambient water temperature to the set temperature. For instance, if you buy your spa in winter and fill it, let's say the water temperature is 10C. You set your desired temperature at 40C, therefore the spa has to heat the water 30 degrees. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on your spa model and if you have a 1.5 kW or 2.2 kW heater, the spa heater will raise the temperature of the water 1 to 2 degrees per hour. This means if you have a 1.5 kW heater, the heater will need to continuously run approximately 30 hours to achieve set temperature. </span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once set temperature is achieved, the heater will only need to raise the temperature 2 to 3 degrees on average to maintain the desired temp after use (although it could be slightly more with consistent use of the bubbler function, especially in colder months). The bubbler draws in ambient outside air into the spa, so use of this function will ultimately lower the temperature of the spa water.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can use the timer option to keep the heater from engaging at times you set. Keep in mind that the water temperature of the spa will slowly drop with the heater not activated and depending on the amount of the drop, it may take more energy to heat the water back up to set temperature vs the heater maintaining a set temperature. Our customers have generally found that leaving the spa running to a set temperature is the most economical and energy efficient.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also please note that the spa filter pump will run continuously with a set temperature. This is nothing to be concerned about and is not unlike many acrylic spas which have 24 hour circulation pumps. Our spa range filter pumps are only 12 volts and 25 watts so energy draw/cost is minimal.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, if we multiply 25 watts x 24 hours, we get 600 watts. This is .6 kW. The average electrical cost per kW in New Zealand is currently 35.67 cents, so for demonstration purposes we'll say 36 cents. Therefore, if we multiply </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.36</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (36 cents) x </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.6</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> kW (600 watts), we get </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.216</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This is approximately 22 cents per day, $6.60 per month (.22 cents x 30 days) or $79.20 per year ($6.60 x 12 months).</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heaters are either 1.5 or 2.2 kW. To find the cost of running the heater, you would need to multiply either 1.5 or 2.2 by the number or hours the heater is actually running per day. Then add that number to the cost of the pump running (approximately 22 cents) to get a daily total.</span></p>","","","General Info","general-info","<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> For MSpas, with inflated liners / shells, please do not deflate or drain the spa unless you are absolutely certain that is necessary to clear any error. </span></p> <p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Similarly, unless you are positive that your error has been resolved, please do not refill your MSpa.

Clean the Control Unit Pipes</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Check your control unit pipes for any residue or debris and give them a good wipe with a cloth or towel.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">2. Flush the Control Unit</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Flush the control unit by turning the hose on and running water through the unit from the inlet pipe until it flows clean and clear out the outlet pipe.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">3. Dry the Control Unit</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Ensure your control unit is dry by holding it in different positions and rolling it from side to side until no more water comes out of the unit.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">4. Clean and Dry the Valves</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">Remove the inlet and outlet valves. Open them by undoing the screw in the centre of the grill. Ensure the valves are clean and dry as well as the pipes between your MSpa and the control unit. Reinsert the valves back into your liner or your control unit (depending on which model MSpa you have).</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">5.

"Inflatable Insulation Bladder Care","inflatable-insulation-bladder-care","<p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">The instructions say stop inflating before all wrinkles have gone. After years of experiencing the deflating insulation bladder, I learnt a few things that I have been applying and haven't had any issues with my insulation bladders since.</p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Proper Inflation</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words""><strong>Only inflate the bladder enough so it doesn't fall out of the cover</strong> (for Mono, Naval and Duet owners) when you put it on your MSpa.</p> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">The hot water of your MSpa will make the air in the bladder expand.</p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Checking for Over-Inflation</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">When you take your insulation bladder off of your MSpa, if you can't easily push your hand into the inflated bladder then it is over-inflated. Let some air out.</p> <h2 class=""text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"">Storage Best Practices</h2> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">I used to take my insulation bladder off my MSpa and stand it on its side next to the house or a fence. While the cover provides some protection for the bladder, this practice does expose some of the bladder to sharp objects that could cause a puncture.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">If Standing on Its Side</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words"">If your available space requires you to stand the insulation bladder on its side, place it on top of some old beach towels or similar so that the chance of something causing a puncture is minimal.</p> <h3 class=""text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"">Recommended Storage Method</h3> <p class=""whitespace-normal break-words""><strong>My strong recommendation:</strong> if you are able, place the insulation bladder upside down on the cover on a flat surface.
