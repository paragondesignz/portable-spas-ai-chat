### Chemical Dispenser - Slow release

**Price:** $15.00 NZD

**Product Page:** https://portablespas.co.nz/products/chemical-dispenser-from-mspa-copy

**SKU:** ST32857

**Tags:** accessories

Stanley small pool/spa floating pill dispenser. Slow release. For all of our MSpa customers that have remote MSpas at your holiday home, BnB etc, and also for those that might be away from your MSpa for a period of time, consider using one of these slow-release chemical dispensers. Dave says: before I leave my MSpa, I make sure the pH is in the ideal range, make sure the inlet and outlet valves are clean and clear and insert a new filter cartridge. Then depending on how long the MSpa will remain unused, I'll put 1 - 3 chlorine tablets into the dispenser, and make sure it's all closed up. The chlorine will then be released slowly into the MSpa over the coming weeks. The longest time I was away from one of my MSpas was 6 weeks, and the water was good as gold. PART-ST32857
